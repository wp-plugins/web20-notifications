== Installation ==

While doing the installation procedure, it is recommended to go through all the steps first before viewing the output. If you don't, you'll get nasty error messages.

= For those with Sidebar Widget compatible themes =

1. Upload folder `web20-notifications` to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I do not receive the test message, what to do? =

If you create a separate account for the plug, then if the plugin does not send you a message through this account, then you want to connect through any icq client and pass the ICQ service. This is a confirmation that through your account does not write the bot. Plugin unfortunately cannot pass the captcha.
